Doc to define requirements, plan, etc

Goal: Create a public calendar of local non-professional theatre event dates. Not sure if I want to expand past this but starting with audition dates and production dates.

Data: Auditions (start date, end date, contact info, sign-up site?); Shows (start date, end date, contact info, ticket page?)
Sources: Eventually all local theatres
    todo: should school theatres be included in this?
    To start: McLean Community Players, Reston Community Players, Little Theatre of Alexandria, Workhouse Arts Center
    Data will be scraped off individual websites, facebook pages or other social media (compare + dedup)
Features: Website displaying dynamic calendar kept up to date with information posted on scraped websites.
    Should have: Searchable calendar, event tags or grouping, notifications/email updates?



1. Use MCP as test case to try and scrape event information
    Will have to store data for X period of time? Website does not have straightforward archive and audition page doesn't contain previous info
2. Set up database for storage
3. Build data scrape pipline
